== Introduction

Some history.


[.bigger]
== 1954

[.big]
== Mark I and Mark II Automatic Language Translators

[transition=zoom]
== !

* Automatic translators from Russian to English, starting with a
250-word vocabulay, translated organic chemistry texts.
* 1960s: the Mark II had a 170,000-word vocabulary and
could cover a wide domain.

== IBM Harvard Mark I

== !

[.big]
== Checkers Player

== !

* First checkers program to demonstrate that computers can learn
from experience.
* Used techniques such as mutable evaluation
functions, hill climbing, and signature tables to explore rote and
generalization learning. 

[.bigger]
== 1972

[.big]

== Robert Mercer

== !

[.big]
== Probabilistic Speech Recognition

== !

* IBM developed the core approach to *probabilistic speech recognition* based on ideas from Information Theory.
* Applied *Information Theory* and probabilistic understanding instead of linguistic understanding.


[.bigger]
== 1984

[.big]
== Real-time Speech Recognition


== !

* First real-time demonstration of a large vocabulary *speech recognition dictation system*.
* Major advance in speech recognition -- accuracy and fundamental underlying model.

[.bigger]
== 1985

[.big]
== Limited Reasoning

[.big]

== Fangin & Halpern

== !

* Introduced and studied several new logics for
belief and knowledge, all of which held that agents are not *logically
omniscient*.

[.bigger]
== 1988

[.big]
== Statistical Translation Between Languages

[background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/IBM_models_03.jpg]
== !


== ! 
* Major advance in teaching a machine how to translate one human language into another.
* Used alignment and Hidden Markov Models.


[.bigger]
== 1992


[.big]
== Gerald Tesauro

== !

[.big]
== TD-Gammon


== !
[%step]
* Nonlinear function approximation and *Reinforcement Learning*.
* Neural net trained by a form of temporal-diference learning (TD).
* Tested in Backgammon by a self-learning program.
* With minimal search reached and surpassed human masters.

[.bigger]
== 1995

[.big]
== Reasoning about Knowledge

== Ronald Fagin, Joseph Y. Halpern, Yoram Moses, Moshe Vardi.

== !

* Provided a general discussion of approaches to reasoning about knowledge and its applications to distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and game theory.
* It brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable.

[.bigger]
== 1997

[.big]
== Deep Blue Chess

== Murray Campbell, Feng-hsiung Hsu, Joe Hoane

== !
[.stretch]
video::NJarxpYyoFI[youtube, start=150, options=autoplay]

== !

First computer to defeat human World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov.

[.bigger]
== 2002

[.big]
== BLEU: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy

== !
* Method of automatic machine translation evaluation.
* Quick, inexpensive, language-independent,  correlates highly with human evaluation, and has little marginal cost per run.

[.bigger]
== 2009

[.big]
== UIMA: Unstructured Information Management

==  Apache UIMA Project Team

== !
[%step]
* Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
* OASIS standard as of March 2009.
* Signaled a major advance in handling real-world unstructured information, which is typically text-heavy, but may also contain dates, numbers and facts.

[.bigger]
== 2009

[.big]
== More Statistical Machine Translation


== Salim Roukos

== !
* Development of a series of steps to estimate more complex translation models from earlier easier -- and cruder -- translation models.
* A sequence of five models was used to estimate a word alignment between the words of a source and a target sentence.
* These models are referred to in the scientific literature as "IBM Model through IBM Model 5» .

[.bigger]
== 2011

[.big]
== Watson Jeopardy! Challenge

== !
[.stretch]
video::P18EdAKuC1U[youtube, start=0, options=autoplay]

== !
[%step]
* First computer to defeat TV game show Jeopardy! champions.
* Research teams are working to *adapt Watson to other information-intensive fields*, such as telecommunications, financial services and government.


[.bigger]
== ... and now.

== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.


== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»
