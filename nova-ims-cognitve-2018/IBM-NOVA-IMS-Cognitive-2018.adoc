== Analytics

[%step]
* «The scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions» (INFORMS)

== The Analytics Maturity Model
[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]
== Analytics

Transforming data into insights for making _better decisions_.
[%step]
* Data -> Insight -> Action

[background-video="./neurons.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive & Analytics

Is Cognitive Computing another layer _on top_ of the existing
analytics ones?

== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»

_- Kelly, J., 2015. *Computing, cognition and the future of knowing*. Whitepaper, IBM Reseach.
Vancouver._

== Cognitive

* Data -> Information -> Knowledge


== Cognitive computing

[%step]
* _extends_ analytics.
*  is able to consume and interpret _unstructured data_.
* addresses _ambiguous_ problems
* interacts naturally with humans

== A breakthrough: Watson and Jeopardy!

== !
[%step]
* First computer to defeat TV game show Jeopardy! champions.
* Research teams are working to *adapt Watson to other information-intensive fields*, such as telecommunications, financial services and government.

== Watson: from concepts to outcomes

IBM *Watson for Genomics* helps analyze a patient’s tumor's
  genomic data by providing information on potential therapeutic
  options with supporting evidence.
  

== Precision Medicine

== Understanding unstructured data

* *Watson for Oncology* _consumes_ the growing body of medical
  literature, guidelines, trials, articles, and patient data,
  _interprets_ medical records and _recommends_ potential courses of
  action.

== Manipal Hospitals: a case study

== Cognitive search

IBM *Watson Discovery* service to adds cognitive search and content
analytics engine to applications to identify patterns, trends and
actionable insights that drive better decision-making.

== Watson Analytics

Watson Analytics is a smart data analysis and visualization service
you can use to quickly _discover patterns and meaning_ in your data –
all on your own. With guided data discovery, automated predictive
analytics and cognitive capabilities such as natural language
dialogue, you can interact with data conversationally to get answers
you understand.

There is this step-by-step tutorial by Ryan Nelson...

== Predictive Analytics and the Internet of Things

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/protecting-endangered-rhinos/
 
* Over the past decade, more than 7,000 rhinos were killed across the African continent.
* In 2016, more than 1,000 were killed in South Africa alone.
* At this rate the rhino could become extinct in less than a decade.


[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]
== How?

Following the sentinels!

[.step]
* Rhinos are _not_ tracked so that they can't be found.
* Other animals are monitored for their behaviour
* The sensor data is used to create rule-based patterns, or algorithms, built on the prey-animals’ response to perceived threat
