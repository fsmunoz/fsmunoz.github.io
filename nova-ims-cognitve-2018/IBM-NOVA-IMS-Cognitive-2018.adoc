== Analytics

[%step]
* «The scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions» (INFORMS)

== The Analytics Maturity Model
[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]
== Analytics

Transforming data into insights for making _better decisions_.
[%step]
* Data -> Insight -> Action

[background-video="./neurons.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive & Analytics

Is Cognitive Computing another layer _on top_ of the existing
analytics ones?

== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»

_- Kelly, J., 2015. *Computing, cognition and the future of knowing*. Whitepaper, IBM Reseach.

== Cognitive

* Data -> Information -> Knowledge

== Cognitive computing

[%step]
* _extends_ analytics.
*  is able to consume and interpret _unstructured data_.
* addresses _ambiguous_ problems
* interacts naturally with humans

== now that we have an idea of what it is

[.big]
== let's catch up with some history.

[.big]
== with some highlights of IBM Research in the field of AI and Cognitive Research

[.bigger]
== 1954

[.big]
== Mark I and Mark II Automatic Language Translators

[transition=zoom]
== !

* Automatic translators from Russian to English, starting with a
250-word vocabulay, translated organic chemistry texts.
* 1960s: the Mark II had a 170,000-word vocabulary and
could cover a wide domain.

Watson Analytics is a smart data analysis and visualization service
you can use to quickly _discover patterns and meaning_ in your data –
all on your own. With guided data discovery, automated predictive
analytics and cognitive capabilities such as natural language
dialogue, you can interact with data conversationally to get answers
you understand.

. Open CSV
. "How to ask" - explains data entry
. Ask "what is the cost of courses by organization?"
. Select "What is the breakdown of Course cost by Organization?"
. Tree map shows ammount of training per org as size of box
. More detail  by clicking in box
. Discoveries panel: without any action Watson Analytics identifies patterns and associations, updated in real-time
. Let's see how it evolved over time: data slots at the bottom
. Tap Multiplier, select Year, Done
. Change the name by double clicking on tab name to "Course Costs"
. Explore from more perspectives: Add a starting point from Discories, the "Course Cost by Department"
. Now find how many new hires are planned: tap "Course cost" in theinteractive title (in blue), tap "External hires"
. Change visualization: Tap Visualization Types, select Packed Bubble.
. The discoveries panel is closed but can be reopened.
. Change the title to "External Hires"
. Now let's find out what is driving expenses!
. Add a new tab to adda new starting point.
. Ask "What drives expense total?", select.
. Watson Analytics applies statistical algorithms to the data to discover insights,patterns, and correlations in the data. The spiral visualization shows you thekey drivers for the target, Expense total. The closer the driver is to the center,the stronger it is
. Change name to Expense Total
. Tap over a dot to see the predictive strength of each driver: Position and Organization impacts expense at 94%.
. Let's add detailed visualization for it: Add Detailed Visualization (+)
. Change name to Drivers and return to landing page
. Creating a Display to share: tap Display->New Display
. Name it and select Dashboard type, select the one with 4 rectangles.
. Add by opening the Personal folder and drag the Course cost  to the top left, External Hires to the bottom left, Expense total to the top right , Drivers to the bottom right
. Add a filter to see the impactof duration: tap filters, "Course days" in the "This tab" filter area. Move the slider and it updates in real-time.
. Tap Course days again to close
. Save to the Personal folder: one could add widgets, media, etc.
. Share!
