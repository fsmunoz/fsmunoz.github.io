== !
* Development of a series of steps to estimate more complex translation models from earlier easier -- and cruder -- translation models.

* These models are referred to in the scientific literature as "IBM Model through IBM Model 5» .

[.bigger]
== 2011

== A breakthrough: Watson and Jeopardy!

[background-iframe=https://www.youtube.com/embed/P18EdAKuC1U?autoplay=1]
== !

== !
[%step]
* First computer to defeat TV game show Jeopardy! champions.
* Research teams are working to *adapt Watson to other information-intensive fields*


== !

Dialogue and conversation are essential areas for cognitive systems.

== !


== Some concepts: "unstructured content" and "annotations".

== !

Unstructured information management applications exist to analyse
large volumes of _unstructured data_ through a variety of analysis
techonologies.

== !

* Statistical and rule-based natural language processing (NLP)
* Information retrieval (IR)
* Machine learning
* Ontologies
* Automated reasoning
* Knowledge sources, for example, CYC, WordNet, or FrameNet

== !

[.quote]
"Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems
that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to
discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user.
-- Apache Foundation UIMA Project

== !

Developed by IBM, it was opened to the community and the
stewarship given to the Apache Foundation. It's an OASIS standard.

== !

* Enables applications to be decomposed into components, for example
  "language identification" => "language specific segmentation" =>
  "sentence boundary detection" => "entity detection (person/place
  names etc.)".

* Each component implements interfaces defined by the framework and
  provides self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files.

* Provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and
  can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing pipelines
  over a cluster of networked nodes.


== !

Definitions are stored in XML files

and used to annotate tokens

== Watson Explorer Content Analytics

* Collects and analyzes structured and unstructured content in
  documents, email, databases, websites, and other enterprise
  repositories
* Uses UIMA annotators
* Uses a "hypothesis free" approach by surfacing data and
  relationships that span both structured and unstructured data.

"I WAS DRIVING MY 2005 FORD FREESTYLE AND HAD COME TO A COMPLETE
STOP. I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE
THE CAR SURGED FORWARD WITHOUT MY EVER HAVING TOUCHED THE
ACCELERATOR. I SLAMMED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR
AHEAD OF ME. MY CAR STALLED AND I WAS ABLE TO RESTART IT. THE CHECK
ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE THROTTLE BODY
NEEDED REPLACEMENT."

== Watson Discovery

* Embedded NLP
* Relevance Training
* Custom Model Annotation/Extraction

[background-iframe=https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery-3/demo/index.html#demo]
== ! 

== Discovery is important to add to _conversations_ and produce a dialogue.

== Watson Assistant

* Create meaningful conversations
* Model natural conversation flows

== !

* Intents and entities, which you create to train Watson to understand meaningful examples

* Slots, which you use to capture context from a user to reduce redundancy

* Handlers, which you manage for users who go off topic

* Dialog flows, which you organize to lead users who digress from the
  conversation back to the original conversation

== With this hability to dialogue we can add content mininging and exploration.

== Watson Expert Assist

== !

Dialogue with domain-specific catalogue and deep knowledge
discovery.

[background-iframe=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/demo/try-watson-expert-assist/]
== !

== Machine Translation

* An area of focus for IBM for decades
* Many existing offerings from various companies
* Several open-source approaches available
* Different models used

== !

As mentioned, Statistic Machine Translation was something in which IBM
had a pioneering role and is still the mostly used model today.

[background-video="../videos/neurons.mp4"]
== !

IBM uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) as the underlying model for
the Watson Translate technology, instead of SMT.

== Natural Language Understanding

* Collection of APIs that offer text analysis through natural language processing.
* It can analyze text to help you understand its concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, and more.
* Allows the creation of new models.

== !

== Tone Analysis

== !

The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to
detect emotional and language tones in written text. The service can
analyze tone at both the document and sentence levels.


== !

[.quote]
"To derive emotion scores from text, IBM Watson Tone Analyzer uses a
stackedgeneralisation-based ensemble framework to achieve greater
predictive accuracy [5].Features such as n-grams (unigrams, bigrams
and trigrams), punctuation, emoticons,curse words, greeting words
(such as “hello”, “hi” and “thanks”) and sentiment po-larity are fed
into machine learning algorithms to classify emotion categories."

== Speech is an aditional area with constant evolution

== !

And essential for cognitive systems

== Summing it up

== !

The evolution of computation and scientific knowledge in linguistics
are changing the way we interact with expert systems radically.
