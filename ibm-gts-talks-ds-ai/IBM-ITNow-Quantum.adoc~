== IBM has a long relation with Physics.

== ...and Physics Engineering...

== _... and Artificial Intelligence..._

[.bigger]
== ...and Science in general.

== Five IBM physicists have received the Nobel Prize in Physics

== !
[.step]
* Leo Esaki in 1973 for his work in semiconductors.
* Gerd Bining and Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope.
* Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller in 1987 for research in superconductivity.

[.big]
== And not just Nobel prizes

Many essential scientific breakthroughs were born from IBM Research
through the decades.

== Quantum tunneling

1958: Leo Esaki's discovery of the semiconductor junction, called the Esaki diode, finds wide use in electronics applications

== Fractal Geometry

1967 - IBM, researcher *Benoît Mandelbrot*.

== Nanotechnology

1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invent the scanning tunneling microscope, revolutionizing our ability to manipulate solid surfaces the size of atoms.

== Quantum teleportation

1993: An international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

== ... and many others

==  Supremacia quântica, vantagem quântica

* Vantagem quântica é a possibilidade de resolver problemas de forma mais rápida que os sistemas clássicos.
* Supremacia quântica é a capacidade de resolver problemas que na prática são impossíveis de resolver classicamente.

== Concepts

[background-image="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/_nuxt/img/d298fe6.svg"]
== Superposition

Superposition refers to a combination of states we would ordinarily
describe independently. To make a classical analogy, if you play two
musical notes at once, what you will hear is a superposition of the
two notes.
