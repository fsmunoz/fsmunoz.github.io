== Five IBM physicists have received the Nobel Prize in Physics

== !
[.step]
* Leo Esaki in 1973 for his work in semiconductors.
* Gerd Bining and Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope.
* Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller in 1987 for research in superconductivity.

[.big]
== And not just Nobel prizes

Many essential scientific breakthroughs were born from IBM Research
through the decades.

== Quantum tunneling

1958: Leo Esaki's discovery of the semiconductor junction, called the Esaki diode, finds wide use in electronics applications

== Fractal Geometry

1967 - IBM, researcher *Benoît Mandelbrot*.

== Nanotechnology

1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invent the scanning tunneling microscope, revolutionizing our ability to manipulate solid surfaces the size of atoms.

== Quantum teleportation

1993: An international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

== !

In the summer of 1981, IBM and MIT organized a landmark event called
the First Conference on the Physics of Computation.

It took place at Endicott House, a French-style mansion not far from
the MIT campus.

[background-image="https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-quantum2.png""]
== !

Bennett and others realized that some kinds of computations that are
exponentially time consuming, or even impossible, could be efficiently
performed with the help of quantum phenomena. A quantum computer would
store information in quantum bits, or qubits.

"Nature is quantum, goddamn it! So if we want to simulate it, we need a quantum computer!"
-- Richard Feynman

== !

Before Quantum computing... let's try quantum mechanics.


== Through the famous double-slit experiment

[background-image=../images/Thomas_Young_by_Briggs.jpg"]
== !

[background-color="white"]
== Particles

image::https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2017/contextuality/double_balls.png[width=70%,role=inline]


== What happens?

Two strips of marks roughly the same shape as the slits.


[background-color="white"]
== Waves

image::https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2017/contextuality/double_waves.png[width=70%,role=inline]


== What happens?

As the wave passes though both slits, it essentially splits into two
new waves, each spreading out from one of the slits. These two waves
then interfere with each other. At some points, where a peak meets a
trough, they will cancel each other out. And at others, where peak
meets peak (that's where the blue curves cross in the diagram), they
will reinforce each other.


== Everything's fine until now...

[.big]
== So let's try the same with electrons.

[background-image="https://plus.maths.org/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2017/contextuality/electrons2.jpg"]
== !

[.big]
== How can this be?

One possibility might be that the electrons somehow interfere with
each other, so they don't arrive in the same places they would if they
were alone.

However, the interference pattern remains even when you
fire the electrons one by one, so that they have no chance of
interfering.

== !

*Each individual electron contributes one dot
to an overall pattern that looks like the interference pattern of a
wave*

== !

Could it be that each electrons somehow splits, passes through both
slits at once, interferes with itself, and then recombines to meet the
second screen as a single, localised particle?

== !

To find out, you might place a detector by the slits, to see which
slit an electron passes through. And that's the really weird bit. If
you do that, then the pattern on the detector screen turns into the
particle pattern of two strips, as seen in the first picture above.

== !

*The interference pattern disappears. Somehow, the very act of looking
makes sure that the electrons travel like well-behaved little tennis
balls.*

[.big]
== This is the wave particle duality.

...in which Heisenberg's uncertainty principle rests: the more
precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less
precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.

[background-image="https://i1.wp.com/braungardt.trialectics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Schr%C3%B6dingers-Cat-3.jpg"]
== ... and the famous Schrödinger's cat

"Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it."
-- Niels Bohr


== But what _is_ a quantum computer?

[background-iframe=https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-FyH2A7Ed0?autoplay=1]
== !

== On a quantum computer, bits and transistors are not used.

== !

Electrons or photons are measured according to their quantum
properties, such as spin, resulting in a calculation of 0, 1, or a
probability between.

== !

Because of the unique properties of these particles at the microscopic
level, *they can hold the value of 0 and 1 simultaneously until
measured*. This property in quantum mechanics is called superposition.


[.big]
== Concepts

==  Quantum supremacy, quantum advantage

* Quantum advantage is the possibility of solving problems faster than on classical systems
* Quantum supremacy is the ability of solving problems which are for praticaly purposes impossible to solve in the classic systems.


[background-image="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/_nuxt/img/d298fe6.svg"]
== Superposition

Superposition refers to a combination of states we would ordinarily
describe independently. To make a classical analogy, if you play two
musical notes at once, what you will hear is a superposition of the
two notes.

[background-image="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/_nuxt/img/282b538.svg"]
== Entanglement

Entanglement is a famously counter-intuitive quantum phenomenon
describing behavior we never see in the classical world. Entangled
particles behave together as a system in ways that cannot be explained
using classical logic.

[background-image="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/_nuxt/img/18a5833.svg"]
== Interference

Quantum states can undergo interference due to a phenomenon known as
phase. Quantum interference can be understood similarly to wave
interference; when two waves are in phase, their amplitudes add, and
when they are out of phase, their amplitudes cancel.

[.big]
== But how do we apply this concepts?

== !
You use quantum gates (like an Hadamard gate), or operations that change the states of the qubits.

== Let's give it a try using the Circuit Composer

[background-iframe="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com"]
== !

== A Python SDK, Qiskit, is also available.

[background-iframe="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com"]
== !

== As are plenty of algorithms that show how quantum computers can break new frontiers.
