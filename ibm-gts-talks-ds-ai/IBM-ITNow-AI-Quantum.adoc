== Concepts

AI, Machine Learning, Cognitive...


== !
[.stretch]
image::../images/the-new-technologies.jpg[width=100%,role=inline]


== Machine Learning

* Provides computers with the ability to continuing learning without being pre-programmed after a manual.
* Algorithms that learn from data and create foresights based on this data.

== Artificial Intelligence

* When machines – based on information – are able to make decisions, which maximizes the chances of success in a given topic.
* By the use of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence is able to
  use learning from a data set to solve problems and give relevant
  recommendations.

== Computação cognitiva

* Systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose and interact with humans naturally
* A mixture of computer science and cognitive science – that is, the understanding of the human brain and how it works

== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»

_- Kelly, J., 2015. *Computing, cognition and the future of knowing*. Whitepaper, IBM Reseach.
Vancouver._

[transition=zoom, %notitle]
[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive

* Data -> Information -> Knowledge

== Cognitive computing

[%step]
* _extends_ analytics.
*  is able to consume and interpret _unstructured data_.
* addresses _ambiguous_ problems
* interacts naturally with humans

== !

and can we use them?


[.bigger]
== Yes!

== !

it's important to understand what IBM Watson is...

== Watson exists in three forms

- *Tools* for companies that want to build their own AI.
- *Applications* for companies that want to buy a pre-packaged AI
  solution.
- Embedded machine learning and AI *features*.

== !

and we'll see examples from all of them.

== Watson Explorer Content Analytics

* Collects and analyzes structured and unstructured content in
  documents, email, databases, websites, and other enterprise
  repositories
* Uses UIMA annotators
* Uses a "hypothesis free" approach by surfacing data and
  relationships that span both structured and unstructured data.

"I WAS DRIVING MY 2005 FORD FREESTYLE AND HAD COME TO A COMPLETE
STOP. I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE
THE CAR SURGED FORWARD WITHOUT MY EVER HAVING TOUCHED THE
ACCELERATOR. I SLAMMED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR
AHEAD OF ME. MY CAR STALLED AND I WAS ABLE TO RESTART IT. THE CHECK
ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE THROTTLE BODY
NEEDED REPLACEMENT."

[background-iframe=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/demo/try-watson-explorer/]
== !

== Watson Discovery

* Embedded NLP
* Relevance Training
* Custom Model Annotation/Extraction

[background-iframe=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/dte/producttour/discover-hidden-insights-your-data]
== ! 

== Discovery is important to add to _conversations_ and produce a dialogue.

== Watson Assistant

* Create meaningful conversations
* Model natural conversation flows

== !

* Intents and entities, which you create to train Watson to understand meaningful examples

* Slots, which you use to capture context from a user to reduce redundancy

* Handlers, which you manage for users who go off topic

* Dialog flows, which you organize to lead users who digress from the
  conversation back to the original conversation

== The use-cases are endless... from food 


https://food-coach.ng.bluemix.net

== ... to banking.

== With this hability to dialogue we can add content mininging and exploration.

== Watson Expert Assist

== !

Dialogue with domain-specific catalogue and deep knowledge
discovery.

[background-iframe=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/demo/try-watson-expert-assist/]
== !

== Machine Translation

* An area of focus for IBM for decades
* Many existing offerings from various companies
* Several open-source approaches available
* Different models used

== !

As mentioned, Statistic Machine Translation was something in which IBM
had a pioneering role and is still the mostly used model today.

[background-video="../videos/neurons.mp4"]
== !

IBM uses https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/07/improving-the-accuracy-speed-of-translations-with-neural-machine-translation/[Neural Machine Translation] (NMT) as the underlying model for
the Watson Translate technology, instead of SMT.

[background-iframe=https://language-translator-demo.ng.bluemix.net/]
== !


== Natural Language Understanding

* Collection of APIs that offer text analysis through natural language processing.
* It can analyze text to help you understand its concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, and more.
* Allows the creation of new models.



== !

https://natural-language-understanding-demo.ng.bluemix.net/

== Tone Analysis

== !

The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to
detect emotional and language tones in written text. The service can
analyze tone at both the document and sentence levels.


== !

[.quote]
"To derive emotion scores from text, IBM Watson Tone Analyzer uses a
stackedgeneralisation-based ensemble framework to achieve greater
predictive accuracy [5].Features such as n-grams (unigrams, bigrams
and trigrams), punctuation, emoticons,curse words, greeting words
(such as “hello”, “hi” and “thanks”) and sentiment po-larity are fed
into machine learning algorithms to classify emotion categories."

== The advances in AI and cognitive computing make use of this data

[background-video="../videos/neurons.mp4"]
== !

* Understand – images, language and other unstructured data.
* Reason – by comprehending domain-specific concepts, forming hypotheses and
  inferring and extracting ideas.
* Learn – by developing and sharpening expertise with each new data
  point, interaction and outcome.
* Interact – with employees and policy holders in a natural way that
  allows cognitive solutions to dissolve barriers between humans and
  machine.


[.bigger]
== Some applications in healthcare

== !

IBM *Watson for Genomics* analyses the genetic information of
carcinoma and suggests possible therapeutical options _while providing evidences of the reasons for the suggestion_.

[background-iframe=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9URgz7V9_0?autoplay=1]
== !


== Undeerstanding non-structured data

*Watson for Oncology* consumes the huge _corpus_ of literature,
guides, studies, papers, clinical trials and pacient data, interprets
medical registies and makes evidence-based recommendations.
