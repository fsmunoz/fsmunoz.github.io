== Sistemas cognitivos são diferentes

[.step]
* Um nível superior de interacção humana.
* Capacidade de  aumentar o conhecimento.
* Adicionam capacidades cognitivas a soluções.
* Utilizam _processos cognitivos_
* Potenciam a exploração e descoberta.

== Sistemas cognitivos

«... Esta plataforma tem de incluir _machine learning_, raciocínio, processamento de linguagem, fala e visão, interacção homem-computador, diálogo e produção narrativa, entre outros...»
_- Kelly, J., 2015. *Computing, cognition and the future of knowing*. Whitepaper, IBM Reseach.
Vancouver._

== Cognitivo

* Dados -> Informação -> Conhecimento

== Computação cognitiva

[%step]
* Vai para _além_ da análise.
* É capazde consumir e interpretar _informação não estruturada_.
* Endereça _problemas ambíguos_.
* Interage naturalmente connosco.

== agora que temos alguns conceitos 

[.big]
== alguma história

[.big]
== através de momemeots fundamentais da IBM Research nos campos da IA e Investigação Cognitiva

* Tested in Backgammon by a self-learning program.
* With minimal search reached and surpassed human masters.

[.bigger]
== 1995

[.big]
== Reasoning about Knowledge

== Ronald Fagin, Joseph Y. Halpern, Yoram Moses, Moshe Vardi.

== !

* Provided a general discussion of approaches to reasoning about knowledge and its applications to distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and game theory.
* It brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable.

[.big]
== UIMA: Unstructured Information Management

==  Apache UIMA Project Team

== !
[%step]
* Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
* OASIS standard as of March 2009.
