== Key factors that fueled disruption


[background-video="../videos/clouds.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
[.big]
== Cloud

== !
"By 2020, businesses without cloud capabilities will be as uncommon as
businesses without Internet are today. 30 percent of the largest new
software investments will exist entirely on the cloud"
-- Gartner 

[.big]
== Rise of mobile

== !
[%step]
* Always-on expectation
* Interaction through mobile
* Restructuring of social life


[background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Internet_map_4096.png]
[.big]
== Internet of Things

== !
* Universal connectivity
* Sensors everywhere
* Huge ammount of data being generated
* Ability to map the physical world to the digital model

== !

[.big]
== So-called _disruptors_ took full advantage of these

== !
* "Digital first" culture competitors
* Perceived the rise of different customer interaction models
* Were able to explore new markets

==  !

"As different as these new disruptors are from one another,
they all display the ability to leverage digital technologies to
understand the customer, sense market shifts, and innovate faster than
the competition."
-- Harvard Business Review, 2016

[.big]
== No industry is immune

== Financial sector

== !
* ATMs are ubiquitous - but being replaced by cashless operations via
  mobile.
* An onslaught of digital invaders like Simple, Tesco Bank, PayPal,
  Square, Alibaba.com, etc.
* The need for speed and innovation pose a constant challenge when
  catering to an ever younger Digital generation.

== !
[.bigquote]
"80% of CXOs are experimenting with different business models or
thinking of doing so, using cloud for innovation."
-- Robert Leblanc, Senior Vice President, IBM Cloud,

== Insurance

== !
* Rapid digitisation and changing customer demographics are putting
immense pressure on the insurers today and making them rethink the way
they run the insurance industry.
* Millennials, have already taken over the baby boomers and now make up a
quarter of the UK population (_Inkling Millenial Report 2015_).
* Almost 20% of millennials say they would buy insurance from
Google since they are easier to reach (IBM Institute of
Business Value study)

== Automotive industry

== !
* The connected car and IoT
* Autonomous driving
* Mobile devices as the main form of interaction

== !
[.bigquote]
"The fear of OEMs is that a car will become a
smartphone on wheels, with cars built around their entertainment value
rather than their hardware value."
-- Paul Fielden (IBM Automotive Global Center of Competence Lead)


[.big]
== There is a direct impact in terms of the social fabric and work relations

== !
[.bigquote]

"According to our estimates, about 47 percent of total US employment is at
risk. We further provide evidence that wages and educational attainment
exhibit a strong negative relationship with an occupation’s
probability of computerisation"
-- Frei and Osborne "The future of employment: how susceptible are jobs to computerisation?"


[background-image=luddites.png]
== !
[.bigquote]

"The sole cause of great riots was the new machines employed in cotton
manufacture; the country notwithstanding has greatly benefited from
their erection [and] destroying them in this country would only be the
means of transferring them to another [...] to the detriment of the
trade of Britain"
-- Mantoux (as cited by Frei and Osborn) 

== !

(but just like then, people are not scared of technology: they're
scared of instability)



[.bigger]
== What about Healthcare?

[background-image=https://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/thoughtleadership/images/healthcare_banner.jpg]
== !

"Global healthcare is experiencing dramatic and remarkable change. New
and emerging technologies – such as artificial intelligence (AI),
cognitive computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and 3D
printing, among many others – are converging to change not only how,
where and with what precision healthcare is delivered, but also the
very definition of healthcare."
-- A Healthy Outlook: Digital Reinvention in Healthcare, IBM Institute for Business Value


== !

image::../images/healthcare_map_ibv.png[width=100%,role=inline] 

== !

* 43% of surveyed healthcare executives say boundaries between their
industry and others are blurring
* 54% of surveyed healthcare.  executives report that traditional
industry value chains are being replaced with new value models.
* 51% of surveyed healthcare 
executives say competition is coming
from new and unexpected places.


== Technological advancements are helping healthcare to become more personalized, more cost-effective and scalable

== !
... while the availability of skilled and semi-skilled healthcare
workers is projected to decline significantly due to changing social
demographics and rapidly evolving technologies

* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»
