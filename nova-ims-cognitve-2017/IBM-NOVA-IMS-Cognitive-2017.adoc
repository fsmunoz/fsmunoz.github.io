Analytics: transforming data into insights for making better decisions.
[%step]
* Data -> Insight -> Action

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive & Analytics

Is Cognitive Computing another layer _on top_ of the existing
analytics ones?

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»

== Cognitive computing

[%step]
* _extends_ analytics.
*  is able to consume and interpret _unstructured data_.
* addresses _ambiguous_ problems
* interacts naturally with humans

== Watson: from concepts to outcomes

IBM *Watson for Genomics* helps analyze a patient’s tumor's
  genomic data by providing information on potential therapeutic
  options with supporting evidence.

== Understanding unstructured data

* *Watson for Oncology* _consumes_ the growing body of medical
  literature, guidelines, trials, articles, and patient data,
  _interprets_ medical records and _recommends_ potential courses of
  action.

== Watson Analytics

Watson Analytics is a smart data analysis and visualization service
you can use to quickly _discover patterns and meaning_ in your data –
all on your own. With guided data discovery, automated predictive
analytics and cognitive capabilities such as natural language
dialogue, you can interact with data conversationally to get answers
you understand.

== Predictive Analytics and the Internet of Things

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/protecting-endangered-rhinos/
 
* Over the past decade, more than 7,000 rhinos were killed across the African continent.
* In 2016, more than 1,000 were killed in South Africa alone.
* At this rate the rhino could become extinct in less than a decade.


[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== How?

Following the sentinels!

[.step]
* Rhinos are _not_ tracked so that they can't be found.
* Other animals are monitored for their behaviour
* The sensor data is used to create rule-based patterns, or algorithms, built on the prey-animals’ response to perceived threat
