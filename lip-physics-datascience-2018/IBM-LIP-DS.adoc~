== ... what is it good for?


== !

(absolutely... something!)

[.bigger]
== But what it is?

== !
plenty of definitions

== !
[.bigquote]
"At its core, data science is applying the scientific method to solve business problems."
-- Seth Dobrin & Jean-François Puget (IBM)

== !

You can further expand on the definition by understanding that we
solve those *business problems* using *artificial intelligence* to create
*predictions and prescriptions* and to *optimize processes*.

== !
[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]

== Analytics

[%step]
* «The scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions» (INFORMS)

== The Analytics Maturity Model
[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

== !

Data Science includes analytics... but it is not (just) analytics.

== So...what does it look like?

== !
Let's hear Alix explaining what she does as a Data Scientist at IBM

A _new frontier_ in Analytics?

== but... what about Physics?

[background-image=http://www.sissa.it/tpp/images/cloudchamber.png]
[.big]
== Is a background in Physics helpful?

== !
[.small]
(spoiler warning: the answer is "yes" regardless of the question)

== !

This is one "laundry list" of what IBM looks for in a Data Scientist

== !
[.step]
* Training as a scientist, with an MS or PhD
* Expertise in machine learning and statistics, with an emphasis on decision optimization
* Expertise in R, Python, or Scala
* Ability to transform and manage large data sets
* Proven ability to apply the skills above to real-world business problems
* Ability to evaluate model performance and tune it accordingly

== A Physics background prepares for *all* of them

== !

(do focus on the programming though)

== !
Crucially, Data Science is about...

(especially when you don't know what to do with it)

== But what's important is to keep asking.

fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics,
chemometrics, information science, and computer science, including
*signal processing, probability models, machine learning, statistical
learning, data mining, database, data engineering, pattern recognition

* Leo Esaki in 1973 for his work in semiconductors.
* Gerd Bining and Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope.
* Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller in 1987 for research in superconductivity.

[.big]
== And not just Nobel prizes

Many essential scientific breakthroughs were born from IBM Research
through the decades.

== Quantum tunneling

1958: Leo Esaki's discovery of the semiconductor junction, called the Esaki diode, finds wide use in electronics applications	

[background-image=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RDVXPxVh-g/U0xE4ANp3LI/AAAAAAAAABc/kJfowUD4Dnc/s1600/6.gif]

1967 - IBM, researcher *Benoît Mandelbrot*.

[background-image=https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8119/8676926026_2ada5d22aa_h.jpg]
== Nanotechnology

1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invent the scanning tunneling microscope, revolutionizing our ability to manipulate solid surfaces the size of atoms.

== Quantum teleportation

1993: An international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

* Applies machine learning to go beyond "black box" models.

== Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals & Life Science

Several projects, including an innovative project with Mundipharma
focused on public awareness and information through a bot with domain
knowledge.

== Some additional ongoing projects:

[.step]
* Adding cognitive support for patients with limited mobility.
* Improve accessability using real-time AI-driven assistance.

== Chatbots

== !
In different industry segments we have active projects around _chatbots_.

[.step]
* Automate first-line assistance.
* Provide an expert assistance with the ability to understand ambiguous queries.
* Add a natural-language interface to an existing solution.

== Automation

Using Watson APIs we have active projects around

[.step]
* Automation using visual recognition.
* Autonomous identification of equipment degradation.


== Classification

For a major industrial company:

* Automatic classification of documents using a taxonomic tree and
  natural language processing.
  
* Streamline classification of
  documents by suggesting classes based on thre analyses of the
  documents (which are _unstructured data_).

[.big]
== Quantum Computing


== !

In the summer of 1981, IBM and MIT organized a landmark event called
the First Conference on the Physics of Computation.

It took place at Endicott House, a French-style mansion not far from
the MIT campus.

[background-image="https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-quantum2.png""]
== !

Bennett and others realized that some kinds of computations that are
exponentially time consuming, or even impossible, could be efficiently
performed with the help of quantum phenomena. A quantum computer would
store information in quantum bits, or qubits.
