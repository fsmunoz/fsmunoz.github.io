== ... what is it good for?


== !

(absolutely... something!)

[.bigger]
== But what it is?

== !
plenty of definitions

== !
[.bigquote]
"At its core, data science is applying the scientific method to solve business problems."
-- Seth Dobrin & Jean-François Puget (IBM)

== !

You can further expand on the definition by understanding that we
solve those *business problems* using *artificial intelligence* to create
*predictions and prescriptions* and to *optimize processes*.

== !
[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]

== Analytics

[%step]
* «The scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions» (INFORMS)

== The Analytics Maturity Model
[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

== !

Data Science includes analytics... but it is not (just) analytics.

== So...what does it look like?

== !
Let's hear Alix explaining what she does as a Data Scientist at IBM

== but... what about Physics?

[background-image=http://www.sissa.it/tpp/images/cloudchamber.png]
[.big]
== Is a background in Physics helpful?

== !
[.small]
(spoiler warning: the answer is "yes" regardless of the question)

== !

This is one "laundry list" of what IBM looks for in a Data Scientist

== !
[.step]
* Training as a scientist, with an MS or PhD
* Expertise in machine learning and statistics, with an emphasis on decision optimization
* Expertise in R, Python, or Scala
* Ability to transform and manage large data sets
* Proven ability to apply the skills above to real-world business problems
* Ability to evaluate model performance and tune it accordingly

== A Physics background prepares for *all* of them

== !

(do focus on the programming though)

== !
Crucially, Data Science is about...

* Leo Esaki in 1973 for his work in semiconductors.
* Gerd Bining and Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope.
* Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller in 1987 for research in superconductivity.

[.big]
== And not just Nobel prizes

Many essential scientific breakthroughs were born from IBM Research
through the decades.

== Quantum tunneling

1967 - IBM, researcher *Benoît Mandelbrot*.

[background-image=https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8119/8676926026_2ada5d22aa_h.jpg]
== Nanotechnology

1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invent the scanning tunneling microscope, revolutionizing our ability to manipulate solid surfaces the size of atoms.

== Quantum teleportation

1993: An international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

== Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century

Jonathan Goldman, PhD in Physics from Stanford "...was intrigued by
the linking he did see going on and by the richness of the user
profiles. It all made for messy data and unwieldy analysis, but as he
began exploring people’s connections, he started to see
possibilities. He began forming theories, testing hunches, and finding
patterns that allowed him to predict whose networks a given profile
would land in..."

== Quantum Computing


== !

In the summer of 1981, IBM and MIT organized a landmark event called
the First Conference on the Physics of Computation.

It took place at Endicott House, a French-style mansion not far from
the MIT campus.

[background-image="https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-quantum2.png""]
== !

Bennett and others realized that some kinds of computations that are
exponentially time consuming, or even impossible, could be efficiently
performed with the help of quantum phenomena. A quantum computer would
store information in quantum bits, or qubits.
