== First mention of cloud computing

[.quote]

"The beauty of Telescript ...  is that now, instead
of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out
there, where a single program can go and travel to many different
sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service."

-- Andy Hertzfeld, Wired.

"The origins of both virtual machines and containers can be traced to
a fundamental shift in hardware and software architectures toward the
late 1950s. The hardware of the time introduced the concept of
multiprogramming, which included both basic multitasking in the form
of simple context-switching and basic multiprocessing in the form of
dedicated I/O processors and multiple CPUs"

-- Allison Randal, "The Ideal Versus the Real: Revisiting the History
   of Virtual Machines and Containers"
