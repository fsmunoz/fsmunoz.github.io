[.bigquote]
To visualize the future of *IBM* you must know something of the past.
-- Thomas J. Watson, Sr.


[.big]
== IBM has a long relation with Physics.

== ...and Physics Engineering...

== _... and Artificial Intelligence..._

[.bigger]
== ...and Science in general.

[.big]
== Five IBM physicists have received the Nobel Prize for Physics

== !
[.step]
* Leo Esaki in 1973 for his work in semiconductors.
* Gerd Bining and Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope.
* Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller in 1987 for research in superconductivity.

== some additional highlights

== Quantum tunneling

1958: Leo Esaki's discovery  of the semiconductor junction, called the Esaki diode, finds wide use in electronics applications

== Fractal Geometry

1967 - IBM, researcher *Benoît Mandelbrot*.

[background-image=https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8119/8676926026_2ada5d22aa_h.jpg]
== Nanotechnology

1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invent the scanning tunneling microscope, revolutionizing our ability to manipulate solid surfaces the size of atoms.

== Quantum teleportation

1993: An international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, confirmed the intuitions of the majority of science fiction writers by showing that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

== We've been here for a while

== and helped to achieve some rather important things

[background-video="./moon.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
[.big]
== some (extremely) big

[background-image="http://research.ibm.com/ibm-q/images/card-360.jpg"]
[.big]
== but always shaping the future


[.big]
== Quantum Computing


== !

In the summer of 1981, IBM and MIT organized a landmark event called
the First Conference on the Physics of Computation.

It took place at Endicott House, a French-style mansion not far from
the MIT campus.

[background-image="https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-quantum2.png""]
== !
Konrad Zuse

Bennett and others realized that some kinds of computations that are
exponentially time consuming, or even impossible, could be efficiently
performed with the help of quantum phenomena. A quantum computer would
store information in quantum bits, or qubits.
