== Disruption

== !

Since 2000, *52%* of companies in the Fortune 500 have either gone
bankrupt, been acquired or ceased to exist.

[background-image=../images/blade-runner.jpg]
== !
(and it started before that...)

== New business models affect society

== ... and society's most complex organism

[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv_bw.jpg]
[.big]

== The City

== this is not new

== and because of that we'll let someone as old as the city of Braga guide use.

[background-image=../images/vitruvius.jpg]
[.big]
== Vitruvius


[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv.jpg]
== Data & Knowledge
[.bigquote]
"...The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches
of study and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgement that
all work done by the other arts is put to test..."
-- Vitruvius (de arch. 2.1.1)

[background-image=../images/pexels-photo-239898.jpeg]
[.big]
== Cities have lots of data

== (this is the Internet of Things, after all)


[background-color="white"]
== !
[.stretch]
image::../images/image1.png[]


== we have data

[.big]
== But what can we do with it?

[background-video="./neurons.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Enter Data Science, Machine Learning...


[.bigger]
== and AI

[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv.jpg]
== Data & Knowledge
[.bigquote]
"...all that is greatest and essential is under the direction of the
thinking power of the mind and the understanding..."
-- Vitruvius (de arch. 6.0.3)

== First, some definitions

== !
[.bigquote]
"At its core, data science is applying the scientific method to solve business problems."
-- Seth Dobrin & Jean-François Puget (IBM)

== !

You can further expand on the definition by understanding that we
solve those *business problems* using *artificial intelligence* to create
*predictions and prescriptions* and to *optimize processes*.

== Analytics

[%step]
* «The scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions» (INFORMS)

== The Analytics Maturity Model
[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

[background-video="./stars.webm",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.


== AI
"By AI we mean anything that makes machines act more intelligently"
-- IBM Research AI Research Group

== This could use "classical" approaches

[background-image=https://images.theconversation.com/files/168950/original/file-20170511-32613-1ipnlda.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C49%2C2048%2C993&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop]
[.big]
== Deep Blue Chess

== and also recent breakthroughs that ended the "AI Winter"

[background-image=https://n1s1t23sxna2acyes3x4cz0h-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/watson_on_jeopardy.jpg]
[.big]
== Watson Jeopardy! Challenge

== !
[%step]
* First computer to defeat TV game show Jeopardy! champions.
* Research teams are working to *adapt Watson to other information-intensive fields*, such as telecommunications, financial services and government.

== And for the city this can be applied in different scales.


[.big]
== to build a Smarter Planet

== !


[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv.jpg]
== Supply chain, then and now
[.bigquote]

"...and selecting a neighbourhood that can supply plenty
of food stuffs to maintain the community, with good roads or else
convenient rivers or seaports affording easy means of transport to the
city..."
-- Vitruvius (de arch. 2.5.1)

== Cities are also big centres of commerce and transportation.

[.big]
[background-image=../images/news-transport-jan18-portofrotterdam.jpg]
== Port of Rotterdam


== !

[%step]
 * 140 000 ships/year
 * 42 km port area
 * 90 000 people employed
 * 3.3% of Dutch GDP


[background-image=../images/port_digital.png]
== !


[background-image=../images/twin.png]
== !

[%step]
 * *Digital twin*
 * *Weather data integration*
 * *Digitisation*
 * *Operational improvements*


== This is also why IBM acquired...

== !

== !
(largest IoT network in the world)

[.big]
== Smarter cities are composed of _smarter places_


[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv.jpg]
== Vertical space
[.bigquote]

"...The accommodations within the city walls being thus multiplied as
a result of the many floors high in the air, the Roman people easily
find excellent places in which to live..."
-- Vitruvius (de arch. 2.8.17)

[background-image="https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/img/hero/hero-kone2.jpg"]
== !
A billion people a day. Millions of elevators. No room for downtime

[background-iframe=http://machineconversations.kone.com]
== !


== Change is inevitable.

[background-image=../images/vitruvius_ideal_rv.jpg]
== Location, location, location...
[.bigquote]
"First comes the choice of a very healthy site"
-- Vitruvius (de arch.2.4.1)

== !
and cities also change with time.

[background-image=../images/antonino.png]
== New routes to new places

== We work with those responsible to enable them to cope with change


[background-image=../images/ioc_tub.png]
== !


== !

integrating many data sources in real-time

[background-image=../images/iot_tub.png]
== !

== !

and providing the tools to analyse all that data

[background-image=../images/watson_tub.png]
== !

[background-image=../images/muralha_romana_medieval.JPG]
== New times, new centralities, new challenges


== Global Urban Trends
[%step]
* Urbanization and decentralization
* Climate change
* Migration

== Social equity

[background-image="./images/image.imageformat.lightbox.822921197.jpg"]
== Inequality has risen to its highest levels in the past three decades, interacting with the other trends in significant ways.

[.big]
== The real challenge?

[background-image=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/literature/science-and-literature-in-the-middle-ages/images/fig049.jpg]
[.big]
== Using AI, IoT and cognitive computing for the betterment of cities

== !

What the future holds?

== IBM Research 5 in 5

[background-image=../images/blockchain-stop.jpg]
== Blockchain

== !

Within the next five years, cryptographic anchors and blockchain
technology will ensure a product’s authenticity -- from its point of
origin to the hands of the customer.

[background-image=../images/leadspace-large.jpg]
== Security & Cryptography

== !

The scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks escalates every year, as
do the stakes. In five years, new methods of attack will make today’s
security measures woefully inadequate.

[background-image=../images/ocean-stop.jpg]
== AI, robots and the oceans

== !

In five years, small autonomous AI microscopes, networked in the cloud
and deployed around the world, will continually monitor the condition
of the natural resource most critical to our survival: water.

[background-image=../images/illustration-net.png]
== AI bias

== !

Within five years, the number of biased AI systems and algorithms will
increase. But we will deal with them accordingly – coming up with new
solutions to control bias in AI and champion AI systems free of it.

[background-image="http://research.ibm.com/ibm-q/images/card-360.jpg"]
== Quantum computing

In five years, the effects of quantum computing will reach beyond the
research lab. It will be used extensively by new categories of
professionals and developers looking to this emerging method of
computing to solve problems once considered unsolvable.


== In short, we need to see the City as continuously reinventing itself.

_"La città di Leonia rifà se stessa tutti i giorni: ogni mattina la popolazione si risveglia tra lenzuola fresche, si lava con saponette appena sgusciate dall’involucro, indossa vestaglie nuove fiammanti, estrae dal piú perfezionato frigorifero barattoli di latta ancora intonsi, ascoltando leultime filastrocche dall’ultimo modello d’apparecchio"_
-- Italo Calvino, Le città invisibili (Le città continue)
