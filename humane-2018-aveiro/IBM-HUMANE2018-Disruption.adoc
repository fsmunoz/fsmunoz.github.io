== Key factors that fueled disruption

* Rise of mobile
* The Cloud
* IoT


== !

* "Digital first" culture competitors
* Different customer interaction models
* New markets

==  !
[.bigquote]
As different as these new disruptors are from one another,
they all display the ability to leverage digital technologies to
understand the customer, sense market shifts, and innovate faster than
the competition.
-- HBR 2016

== Keeping up

The use of data, analytics, and automation is considered essential to
resist the onslaught.

[.big]
== Digital intelligence


== !
* Digitalisation by itself is not enough.
* Analytics is needed to use the data to make better, more informed choices.

[.big]
== No industry is immune

== Financial sector

* ATMs are ubiquitous - but being replaced by cashless operations via mobile.
* An onslaught of digital invaders like Simple, Tesco Bank, PayPal, Square, Alibaba.com, etc.
* The need for speed and innovation pose a constant challenge when catering to an ever younger Digital generation.

== !

[.bigquote]
80% of CXOs are experimenting with different business models or thinking of doing so, using cloud for innovation.
-- Robert Leblanc, Senior Vice President, IBM Cloud,

== Insurance

* Rapid digitization and changing customer demographics are putting
immense pressure on the insurers today and making them rethink the way
they run the insurance industry.
* Millennials, who are the true digital
generation, have already taken over the baby boomers and now make up a
quarter of the UK population as per the Inkling Millenial Report
2015.
* Almost 20% of millennials say they would buy insurance from
Google since they are easier to reach as per a recent IBM Institute of
Business Value study.

== Automotive industry: "smartphones on wheels"

* The connected car and IoT
* Autonomous driving
* Mobile devices as the main form of interaction

== !
[.bigquote]
The fear of OEMs is that a car will become a
smartphone on wheels, with cars built around their entertainment value
rather than their hardware value.
-- Paul Fielden (Global Center of Competence Lead, IBM Automotive)
== Analogs vs Digitals

== !

From the HBR study:

* A cement company invested in analytics.
* An hospitality company invested heavily in analytics to people
  skilled in analysing digital trends.
* Pharma companies are analysing data to track usage.


== Out with old, in with the new?

[background-image="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/44154932/cdn.indiewire.0.0.jpg"]
[.big]
== The Incumbents Strike Back

== !

"What’s required, now more than ever, is the fortitude for perpetual reinvention."

== Dancing with disruption

Seventy-two percent of C-suite executives tell us that innovative
industry incumbents lead the disruption in their industry

[.big]
== What changed?

== One wave of disruption may be abating.

[%step]
* Ubiquitous mobility and digital media have already shaken up the most
susceptible industries.
* The number of business startups in the United States recently reached a 40-year low.
* Incumbents honed their skills to acquire nascent disruptors, along
  with their digital skills and innovator talent.
  

== Disruption without startups

* Disruption hasn’t gone underground. Instead, it’s emerging as a
capability incumbents are ready to embrace.
* Innovation is no longer the province of the hungry upstart. 

[.big]
== The path to personalization

== !

_In three sectors alone – retail, healthcare and financial services –
personalization will drive a revenue shift of USD 800 billion to the
15 percent of companies that get it right._

== !

_Discriminant analysis of C-suite executives’ responses to our
questions reveals that one factor, more than any other, distinguishes
the leaders – the Reinventors – from other organizations. It is the
capacity to use data to identify unmet customer needs._

== AI and the search for effective personalisation

As design thinkers, Reinventors are always on the hunt for new clues
that reveal customer needs. Over one-quarter of Reinventors turn to
artificial intelligence technologies and cognitive solutions to better
understand customers and improve the customer experience.

[.big]
== Orchestrating the future

== !

On average, platform orchestrators grow revenues faster and generate
higher profits than other business models, earning market valuations
as high as eight times revenue

== How to do it?

[%step]
* *Create value from reciprocity* – Adopt a deeply collaborative
   approach that spans an ecosystem to create win-win propositions
* *Capitalize on data* – Cultivate and orchestrate data as their most
   important asset to hone performance and the capacity for continuous
   change
* *Commit to innovation* – Reallocate capital and resources from
   defending markets to innovating in new ones.

== Cooperation and competition

The biggest step change between Platform Builders and the Platform
Operators that already have platforms in place is their attitude
toward competitors.


== !

_Six of Canada’s leading banks – the Bank of Montreal, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Desjardins Group, Royal Bank of Canada,
Scotiabank and TD Bank – came together to establish a digital identity
verification service on a blockchain platform._

== Capitalise on data

[%step]
* be open to mutual advantage
* double down on data

== Commit to inovation

Those who’ve already established a platform model are allocating on average 9.0 percent of their capital toward it.

[.big]
== Innovation in motion

Cultivating autonomy and continuous learning by implementing a more
fluid work structure made up of cross-functional teams.

== Becoming agile

[%step]
* *Dynamic vision*: understanding where the industry is heading, promote
  transparency and dialogue with employees, clearly express the
  overall company vision.
* *Open culture* : promote active employee participation, empower teams, promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.
* *Agile operations*: invest in continuos employee skills development,
   reward both fast failure and sucessful innovation, adopted a fluid
   work structure built on cross-functional teams.


[.big]
== Actions to take now


== Interrogate your environment

[%step]
* Remain on high alert and avoid complacency about past successes.
* Design and play a new offense.
* Get ever closer.

== Commit with frequency
[%step]
* Divest to invest.
* Invest for new growth.
* Prioritize advocacy and co-creation over advertising.

== Experiment deliberately

* Seek innovation over institutionalization.
* Write new rules.
* Find energy in motion.


[.big]
== Architect for disruption


* Relentlessly reduce unit IT costs by putting the right workload on
  the most suitable best-fit infrastructure.
* Easily and securely store, process and find value in a continuous
  volume of structured and unstructured data.
* Continually improve and personalize user experiences by infusing
  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies.
* Rapidly design, deploy and maintain your new transformative
  applications.


== Beyond digital disruption

[.big]
== Cognitive disruption

== !
* Understand – images, language and other unstructured data in claims
  photos, underwriters’ notes and contact center recordings.
* Reason – by comprehending insurance concepts, forming hypotheses and
  inferring and extracting ideas.
* Learn – by developing and sharpening expertise with each new data
  point, interaction and outcome.
* Interact – with employees and policyholders in a natural way that
  allows cognitive solutions to dissolve barriers between humans and
  machine.
